Bismark report for: fastq/example_g1_R1.fastq.gz and fastq/example_g1_R2.fastq.gz (version: v0.22.1)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /Users/jordiabante/Documents/code/julia/CpelAsm.jl/test/fasta/allele-1/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	200
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	200
Mapping efficiency:	100.0% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	0
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	0
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	2

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	110	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	88	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0

Total unmethylated C's in CpG context:	314
Total unmethylated C's in CHG context:	211
Total unmethylated C's in CHH context:	696
Total unmethylated C's in Unknown context:	0

C methylated in CpG context:	80.5%
C methylated in CHG context:	81.7%
C methylated in CHH context:	80.9%
Can't determine percentage of methylated Cs in unknown context (CN or CHN) if value was 0
